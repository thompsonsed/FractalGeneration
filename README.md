# Fractal Generation
Generate fractals using python and tensorflow.

The `FractalGenerator` class in *fractal_generator.py* contains the operations for generating the fractals (either a Julia or Mandelbrot) and applying different colour transforms to generate the images.

For examples and explanations check out *mandelbrot.ipynb*. 

To find additional fractals generated for http://thompsonsed.co.uk/programming-fractal-art-using-tensorflow, check out *pretty_fractals.ipynb*.
