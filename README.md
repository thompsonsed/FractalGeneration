# Fractal Generation
Generate fractals using python and tensorflow - check out my [accompanying blog 
post.](http://thompsonsed.co.uk/?p=1156)

The `FractalGenerator` class in *fractal_generator.py* contains the operations for generating the fractals (either a Julia or Mandelbrot) and applying different colour transforms to generate the images.

For examples and explanations check out *mandelbrot.ipynb*. 

To find additional fractals generated for http://thompsonsed.co.uk/?p=1156, check out *pretty_fractals.ipynb*.

Images are generated in the *images* folder, and the Julia set gif is stored in *gifs*.
